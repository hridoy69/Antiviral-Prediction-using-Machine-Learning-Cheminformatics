# Antiviral_Prediction
Seven Machine Learning algorithms Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, KNN, Decision Tree, MLP Classifier and Logistic Regression were benchmarked on a set of 2358 antiviral compounds compiled from the CAS COVID-19 antiviral SAR dataset. RF and XGBoost performed best in all the feature selection methods with maximum predictive accuracy.
A total 1157 two-dimensional molecular descriptors were computed among which, the most highly correlated descriptors were selected using Tree-based, Correlationbased and Mutual information-based feature selection methods.The best performance was achieved by the models developed using Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms in all the feature selection methods. The maximum predictive accuracy of both these models was 88% with internal validation. Whereas, with an external dataset, a maximum accuracy of 93.10% for XGBoost and 100% for Random Forest based model was achievable. Furthermore, the study demonstrated scaffold analysis of the molecules as a pragmatic approach to explore the importance of structurally diverse compounds in data driven studies.
